# Golang Academy

In this tutorial, we will discuss about basic usage of Golang with simple example. Environment used in this tutorial is Linux environment, as this artice is written we are using Linux machine with Ubuntu OS, but you can used any other linux distribution you like :)

Topics covered in this tutorial are:
- [Installation](installation/installation.md)
- [Project structure best practices](project-structure/project-structure.md)
- [Variable](variable/variable.md)
- [Data types](data-types/data-types.md)
- [Struct](struct-and-interfaces/Struct.md)
- [Interfaces](struct-and-interfaces/Interface.md)
- [Function](functions-and-methods/Function.md)
- [Method](functions-and-methods)
- [Error handling](error-handling/Error.md)
- [Packages and import library](packages/README.md)
- [Control flow (if else, switch, for, defer)](control-flow/README.md)
- [Concurrency - goroutine and channels](concurrency/README.md)
- [Http service using standard library](rest-api/restapi-native.md)
- [Http service using Gorilla mux (third party library)](rest-api/restapi-gorillamux.md)
- [Graphql](graphql/README.md)

To support your hands on for trying code in this tutorial, we suggest to prepare code editor. Most favorite used editor for Golang are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (need to install golang plugins) and [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/download/). For online editor you can use [Golang Play Ground](https://play.golang.org/) but its only support for Go standard library

Hope this article can help to get started in Golang. Happy Coding and lets Go :)
